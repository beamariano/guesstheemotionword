# Guess the Emotion Word!

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

## About

Created using vanilla JavaScript, this game is a less macabre version of Hangman. The player has to guess the randomly-generated emotion word by clicking letters in the keypad. This project was borne from my interest in words, psychology, learning and emotions. The app can be used for learning and familiarizing oneself with emotion words.
